This code is contains an algorithm for duplicate detection!
To use my python code, you need to download the (.xlsx) file named output. This contains the data. 
When you want run the code, you can decide how many bootstraps you want to do. Also you can decide which data set you want to use
Train or test data, just set the data_use on 184 equal to the data you want to use, the results appear in the  list called Bootstrap list.

Goodluck! ;)
